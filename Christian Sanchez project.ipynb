    "Changes\n",
    "During our discussion with the professor, we realized that we needed to obtain more data sources than what we had. This is one of the changes that we had to make, so we added another source to our project. We also saw that our data cleaning was ok so no changes were made to that. For this project, we will aim to visualize all of the data and try to connect different sources together in order to find a correlation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "The first dataset that will be analyzed is obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) website. The table provides estimated national average vehicle emissions rates for different vehicle types using gasoline and diesel fuel. \n",
    "The second dataset is obtained from the Fuel Economy website, which is maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy. The table contains data on the fuel economy of different vehicles, including passenger cars and trucks, as well as information on the emissions generated by these vehicles. The original size of the data is 2539 rows and 18 columns.\n",
    "The third dataset is obtained from the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The original size of the data is 5  rows and 30 columns. The table provides data on the emissions of greenhouse gasses from different sectors, including transportation, energy, and industry.\n",
    "The fourth dataset is obtained from https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy which contains data on the range and efficiency of electric vehicles. The original size of the data is 4298 rows and 67 columns. Each row provides information on a specific electric vehicle, such as its make, model, and range, etc. .\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the data from these various sources we are able to make judgments about the environmental effect of electric vehicles and how they stack up against other kinds of vehicles. As automakers, and customers who are interested in lessening the environmental effect of transportation may find this information to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "In these modern times, we often hear about electric vehicles being the future of the automobile industry because of its many advantages over conventional gas powered cars. Our aim for this project was to ask the question “Are electric vehicles actually good for the environment, or is their impact the same as gas cars?”\n",
    "Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Christian:\n",
    "How do emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds vary across different vehicle types and fuel types, and how have these emissions changed over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamza:\n",
    "What factors are most strongly associated with higher fuel efficiency, and how do these factors vary by vehicle type, fuel type, and model year? Can we identify specific vehicle models or manufacturers that consistently have high fuel efficiency ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Paul:\n",
    "What share of total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States can be attributed to transportation, and how have these emissions changed over time? How do emissions from different transportation modes (e.g. cars, trucks, buses) contribute to overall transportation emissions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abanoub:\n",
    "What is the correlation between fuel economy and vehicle weight in cars used for testing fuel economy?\n",
    "Is there a difference in fuel economy performance between domestic and foreign cars used for testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first set of data that Christian cleaned is related to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics."

In order to get around this problem, we have to look for other kinds of data that infer what we are looking for and compare multiple csv files in the hopes of finding a correlation. For this reason, we are not able to find concrete results related to our problem statement. It also means that we are not on the timeline that we expected with our project in order to finish on time. We would need to go back and find more data or change our problem statement a bit to something that can be discovered while using the data that we have collected so far.\n",

If that doesn't work, we plan on looking for new data on the internet that can help us instead of what we have already collected. The last resort of this would be to completely change our problem statement to something that can be found using what we have cleaned and collected so far in this project.\n",
